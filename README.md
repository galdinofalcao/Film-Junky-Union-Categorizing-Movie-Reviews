# Film-Junky-Union-Categorizing-Movie-Reviews

## **Description of the Problem:**
Film Junky, an edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is challenged with efficiently filtering and categorizing a vast array of movie reviews. A dataset of IMDb movie reviews with polarity labeling is available, highlighting the need for a system that can automatically detect negative reviews.

## **Project Goal:**
The project aims to train a machine learning model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative, ensuring reliable detection of negative feedback. The target is to achieve an F1 score of at least 0.85 to guarantee robust performance in real-world applications.  

## **Tools and Libraries:**
- Python: Use Python programming language for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- Pandas: Manipulate and preprocess the data efficiently.
- Numpy: Perform numerical operations and handle array-based computations.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: Create visualizations and charts for data exploration and presentation.
- NLTK: Handle natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stopwords removal.
- Scikit-Learn (Sklearn): Model training, cross-validation, evaluation, and selection.
- PyTorch (torch): Build and run deep learning models.
- Transformers: Leverage pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT) for advanced natural language processing.
- TQDM: Display progress bars to monitor long-running loops and processes.
  
## **Data Documentation:**
The dataset contains the training and test sets. The information given is as follows:
- imdb_reviews: dataset 
- pos: the target, '0' for negative and '1' for positive
- ds_part: 'train'/'test' for the train/test part of dataset
